# 3

Example that uses C++ code (main.cpp) in an R project (main.R).

In this case, the C++ function DoMagic is called, a function that takes a std::vector<int> and returns an int, using the C++11 standard.

This approach failed, because 
 * I have to use Xubuntu 14.04.1 LTS
 * The needed R package `Rcpp11` needs at least R version 3.1.2, I have R version 3.0.2
